# Parse vs ast

## Parse tree

E -> T | T + E
T -> F | F * T
F -> (E) | n

Details of how you go through the document and how you interpret it.

## AST (Abstract syntax tree)
    +
   / \
  3   5

Almost like a compiler

Bytes -> Chars -> Tokens -> AST 
                             |
                           Parser
                            / \
                           /   \
                Rec Desc.       Shift Reduce
                  |
                  |
                Looks like
                Grammar

Recursive descent cant use left recursion

AST * expr(){
    AST *t = term()
    if(match('+)
        append(expr())
    )
}

### Tool built (prefers left recursion)
Shift into tokens from Lex/scanner once some grammar rule is certain
reduce using that rule

WILL BE A QUESTION ABOUT AST VS PARSE WITH EXAMPLES
SOME KIND OF REGEX
    ex. cat(s|log)? match?

Why are languages with garbage collectors unsuitale for real time systems
    or explain how a garbage collector works

Why is reference counting not complete
    what is the flaw of reference counting from pov of garbage collector
    what is the advantage

Alias questions

In a primitive type language why are all objects immutable

What is expensive about an everything as an object language

Explain this in an alias sort of language:
    x=3
    y=x
    y=y+1

Explain difference between pass by value and pass by reference
